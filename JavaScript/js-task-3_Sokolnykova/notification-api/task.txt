# Notification API

Your task is to create a convenient API to show notifications.
It must be either a global object, or a JavaScript class.

* There must be different notifications for error, success and information cases
* Notifications must be able to display arbitrary text or markup
* Notifications must disappear after 10 seconds
* Notifications must disappear when user clicks on them

## Optionally:

* Provide a way to control timeout of disappearing
* Provide a way to disable timeout completely
* If there are more than 5 notifications on screen at once, the oldest one should disappear
